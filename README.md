# SolCard

SolCard is a debit card for the homeless and undocumented.

The QR code printed on the physical debit card points to a payment page that allows donors to donate directly (fiat and crypto), the money is then at the disposal of the beneficiary. The project includes a robust community-powered KYC process so that the beneficiaries donâ€™t need any physical address, mobile phone or anything. The system allows for donations to a community of beneficiaries.

## Motivation

Around the globe, more and more people are transitioning to a cashless existence. China and Scandinavia are places where people rarely use cash anymore. This presents additional challenges to those who find themselves on the edges of society. Full participation in the cashless economy requires access to government-issued documents, bank accounts, and mobile computation. But, as we all know, the most vulnerable members of our society, homeless and refugees, are excluded through these inhumane barriers to entry. And now that the rest of us are making the transition, will we walk past them, indifferent to their plight, and unable to spare a dime? Will we transcend into the decentralized cloud and leave them all behind?

We would like to propose a radical experiment to solve this issue.

## Donation

1. A donor scans a card
2. He makes a donation (fiat or crypto)

## Onboarding

1. An activator request new cards
2. He/she gives one to a beneficiary
